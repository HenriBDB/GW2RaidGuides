                If you don't kill the Elemental during at the start if burn phases that spanws East at 1st burn phase then North-East at 2nd 
                burn phase, then it will go straight for you spirits and likely kill at least one. In order to preserve your most valuable spirits, 
                I recommend calling your water spirit between Qadim and the Elemental and the other spirits slightly to th side. That way only water 
                will die (which is fine) and your other spirits will already be in the right place for when players come back from killing pyre(s).

            <p>
                Atfer killing the Matriarch and Patriarch, place your spirits in a safe spot on a platform before the last set of blue bouncing 
                balls and they should still be alive for when you arrive on Qadim so you can call them to the stack.
