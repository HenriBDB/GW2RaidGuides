                The rule for your elite skill is: when in doubt, take <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="12569"></span>. 
                However, there are situations for which you will want to take another elite skill to handle mechanics or specificities of a fight better. Those 
                are described below.
            </p>
            <div class="row mt-3">
                <div class="col-lg-2" data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="12569"></div>
                <p class="col-lg-10 my-0">
                    You will take this elite skill 90% of the time as the passive healing of the skill allows your dps players to maintain scholar 
                    uptime and helps you replenish your <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31869"></span>. 
                    In addition, the <WikiIcon name="Stability"/> Stability the active skill of this spirit provides can help on <WikiIcon name="Cairn"/> Cairn 
                    for greens or on <WikiIcon name="Gorseval"/> Gorseval for slams for example.

                    This elite is usually taken for the <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> Immobilise it inflicts but can also be used on condi druid for extra 
                    dps as it also deals a decent amount of condi damage. The way it works is by growing vines under a target that pulse <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> Immobilise (2s) 
                    and <WikiIcon name="Bleeding"/> Bleeding (8s). Those vines can be destroyed if damaged by an enemy entity. 
                    <br/>
                    This skill is an 
                    absolute saviour on <WikiIcon name="Vg"/> Vale Guardian to control the seekers however beware that if a player steps into a 
                    seeker's aoe and trigger it's damaging pulse then it can destroy the vines and won't receive <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> Immobilise 
                    anymore. 
                    <br/>
                    Some druids like to use it on <WikiIcon name="Gorseval"/> Gorseval to stop the adds during the split phase but I feel this 
                    is a waste as that can easily be achieved by using <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31503"></span> twice 
                    thanks to <span data-armory-embed="traits" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="1064"></span>.
                    <br/>
                    This skill is useful on <WikiIcon name="Escort"/> Escort to help <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> Immobilise the Wargs when they aproach Glenna.
                    <br/>
                    This elite skill is also useful on <WikiIcon name="Samarog"/> Samarog to keep Rigom under the boss during the split phase. Do 
                    note that when Rigom explodes, his destroys the vines from this skill so if you want reliable <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> Immobilise 
                    then I would suggest using <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31503"></span> or&nbsp;
                    <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31700"></span> at the start and 
                    waiting for the first explosion (damaging orange circle around Rigom) before using <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="12580"></span>.
                    <br/>
                    The last boss on which this skill can be taken is <WikiIcon name="Deimos"/> Deimos to control the incoming prides although I 
                    would rather recommend using <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31503"></span>,&nbsp;
                    <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="31700"></span> and&nbsp;
                    <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="44980"></span> for the job. 
                    If you do end up taking <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="12580"></span> to 
                    control the prides then don't leave it untouhed before they appear. You can boost teh dps of classes that benefit from uniqu conditions by using 
                    it regularly before 40% (when the prides appear).

                    The incredible power of this elite skill is its condition cleanse and prevention for the whole duration of its channel! This 
                    can be exploited to cheese through some mechanics like: the shake on <WikiIcon name="Slothasor"/> Slothasor, Zane's blind field on Trio, 
                    the confusion circle during the pizza attack at <WikiIcon name="KC"/> Keep Construct and on <WikiIcon name="Dhuum"/> Dhuum, 
                    if you already have a second druid with <span data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-size="20" data-armory-inline-text="wiki" data-armory-ids="12569"></span>, 
                    then you can take it to prevent <WikiIcon name="Torment"/> Torment application during the greater death mark (soul split).
