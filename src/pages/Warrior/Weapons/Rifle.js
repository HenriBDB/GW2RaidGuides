            Rifle is a weapon that is never used outside of a niche push strategy on Keep Construct where
            Rifle Butt is used for pushing the orb into a rift and out after a chrono has pulled it closer to the
            rift, which allows for a single rift to be done in a second if timed right. Outside of that riffle is
            just bad, not holding enough raw damage to be worthwhile for power builds and almost no
            damaging conditions to speak of for a condition build.

                Mediocre damage even with Crack Shot. With the May 11 change they turned it from a bad skill with unnecessary
                side effect to just a bad skill, which the option of slightly more damage. It is still bad.

                Does respectable damage, the recharge is just way too slow, and it takes too long to fire, so it
                ends up being no better than mediocre as well.

                A poor attempt at making rifle relevant. The coefficient is bad, and the cleave is highly irellevant for
                most encounters. The only thing it is good for is quickly ramping vulnerability, and you can do the same
                with mace offhand, which would still allow you to have access to axe burst instead of mediocre rifle skills.

                The evade ends up being a curse more often than a blessing. You are locked out of doing
                anything for its duration which destroy any potential for this skill. The damage is way too low
                for the time you lose during the evade.

                The only save and grace on Rifle. The knockback is amazing, the recharge is good, and it does
                respectable damage for its cast time as well. The main problem with the recharge is that even if
                the other skills have charges, you still have to wait 5 seconds between casts so it just seems
                pointless to have the charges in the first place as youâ€™ll eventually get stuck auto-attacking
                anyways.

                Very good damage for its cast time, though it has a slightly long aftercast which cannot be
                ignored, which overall makes it feel slow even if it is supposed to be rather fast. Still not good
                enough to warrant any closer remarks.
