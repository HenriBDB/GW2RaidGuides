                This encounter does technically not need a banner warrior and banners themselves does not fit
                into how the encounter plays out, not to add that the banner buff is not needed for the
                encounter. Power is preferred for this encounter as it deals with the spirits faster than the
                condition build.

                If you were to cast banners you would constantly have to cast them max range ahead of
                yourself, and pick them up and recast them as you pass by them with Desminaâ€™s bubble, or drop
                them as you run towards the spirits and pick them up as they die before running along the
                others, which is overall impractical and unnecessary.
