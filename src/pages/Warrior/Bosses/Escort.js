                This is also a fairly unconventional encounter. Your duty as warrior will usually be warg duty or
                stack on the rest of the group. If you do have to do wargs the core condition build is great for
                this purpose as Flurry (core Sword burst) immobilizes <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> for 4 seconds base at max adrenaline,
                and since you replace Berserker trait-line with Tactics you get Leg Specialist which makes your
                auto-attack chain apply immobilize <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> on Hamstring Cripple <WikiIcon name="Crippled"/> as well. You can take Throw Bola
                instead of Shattering Blow in case you want some extra immobilizes <WikiIcon name="Immobile"/> available. Remember that
                you do not need to kill the wargs, but just make sure that they do not reach the group before the
                first part of the encounter is completed.

                Banners are not super important here as by the time you get to the boss at the end of the
                encounter it is almost dead already, but once you arrive you just place the banners on the group
                and leave them there until the boss is dead.
