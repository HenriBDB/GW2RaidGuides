                Given how differently this encounter plays out compared to most other encounters it is not as
                strict in how you approach it. What most groups expect from the warrior on this encounter is
                that they bring CC for the saboteurs. The saboteurs have a breakbar of 200, so most sources of
                CC will break the bar instantly. The CC requirement means that power is favoured since they can
                bring additional CC without much loss, but really it does not matter too much for this encounter.

                I personally run Hammer and Rifle, with Stomp, Wild Blow, and Kick for utilities to play Ping-
                Pong with the saboteurs, knocking them all over the place before they even get to being planting
                the bomb. Banners is by no means required to bring since most of the encounter is time gated
                anyways, and the 3 mini-bosses and all the adds are not hard to kill. If you do bring banners just
                make sure to place them where the next mini boss will spawn a few seconds before it spawns.
                Beyond that just keep the saboteurs under control and your job is done.
