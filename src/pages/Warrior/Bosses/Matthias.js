                Matthias is heavily a condition favoured fight. Power is still playable, but because of the
                frequent bubbles which prevent damage you can end up dumping half a berserk into the bubble
                dealing 0 damage through all of it. While the bubble prevents damage, it does not prevent
                condition application, even if the conditions do not deal damage while the bubble is up, they will
                deal damage once it is broken. This means that dumping half a berserk into the bubble with the
                condition build will net more damage as the conditions applied while the bubble is up lingering
                and will continue to deal damage once the bubble is broken.

                When playing power on this fight it can be worthwhile to bring Maces to help save the sacrifices.
                The breakbar on the people about to be sacrificed is 2500 and the Maces can get rid of 1080 of
                that on their own. One should however be careful with the damage the Maces still deals given
                the power build, so pay attention to the health of the sacrifice and use Tremor and Head Butt
                before Pommel Bash and Skull Grinder.

                For the condition build it is important to pay attention to how your Scorched Earth fire fields
                lines up with the middle of the arena where the sacrifices will be placed, since they can quickly
                melt through the sacrifice health pool. So, pay attention to positioning so you do not cleave the
                sacrifice. Try instead to hit the ice patches which spawns during the snowstorm phase to
                remove them with the Burning. Savage Leap can be used to quickly get to or back from the
                fountains when you need to cleanse corruption. Shattering Blow can be used to reflect some
                projectiles during the bubble if the main source of reflection fails, but you should not rely on
                this, as it only reflects a few projectiles. This is a fight where you might need to run Sundering
                Bursts in the Arms trait-line in case there is problems with Vulnerability stacks.
