                Another DPS golem so to speak, the boss is very linear, especially with consistently high DPS
                and good scout management. The only things you have to pay attention to is banner uptime for
                both builds and cleave as well for the condition build. The banner patterns are basically the
                same as Cairn. This is another boss where you can prestack adrenaline by using the damage
                fields on the arena before the fight start to get into combat, and then stacking adrenaline with
                weapon swaps, to start the fight at full adrenaline.

                For power you just want to ensure that you are flanking, and then go hard on DPS. You should
                play Tactics here if you are in an organized group with multiple power DPS present, but
                otherwise just stick to Strength. Outrage is also a great choice as the fight is just one long phase,
                so you can gain a lot from the extra berserk duration. Signet of Might is still completely viable.
                Remember that you can deal damage while moving since it can be relevant depending on how
                the spike patterns lines up.

                For the condition build you should pay attention to your positioning and line yourself up so you
                can cleave the scouts as the move down the arena to gain and maintain more stacks of Furious
                Surge. You should be able to cleave the scout in the lane which the boss is currently tanked in,
                and scouts in the lane to the left and right of it. You will only be able to reach the scouts with
                Scorched Earth until they have moved further down the lanes but do still remain lined up for all
                skills to ensure you are not misjudging the range.

                As mentioned earlier the banner pattern is practically the same as with Cairn. Keep the banners
                in the corner of the piece you are currently stacking on and pick them up and replace them
                whenever you get out of berserk. The group starts in position A.
