                For this encounter both the power and condition build work, but the power build has a slight
                edge as you can bring Maces to help break the breakbars which are 2000 strong. Given the small
                size of this breakbar and its frequency it is rarely worth bringing more than an off-hand Mace
                with paralyzation sigil if the whole group contributes to breaking the bar.

                If CC is not a problem and you need to do a button for the pre-phase you can bring Rifle to deal
                some damage while doing a button. The Rifle can also be used to clear shards during phase 2
                without putting yourself at risk by having to move to the shards. You can play Outrage on this
                boss as the phases are fairly lengthy, so the extra berserk duration can be beneficial. Both
                Outrage and Signet of Might are great though. Remember to make use of the extra adrenaline
                gained from cleaving the adds by using Decapitate whenever it is available rather than strictly
                following the rotation.

                The condition build has an easier time doing buttons at the pre-phase as you can just camp bow
                while standing on the button to deal some damage. Likewise the amazing range on Scorched
                Earth can help cleave crystals during phase 2 if you line yourself up accordingly, and overall just
                try to hit as many adds as you can with Scorched Earth and Flaming Flurry to gain more Furious
                Surge stacks. If you get ported during the 2nd phase you can use Savage Leap upon returning to
                quickly get back to the boss.

                Banners on this boss can be chaotic if you get ported during phase 2, but it otherwise fairly
                straightforward once you know how to approach it. Start the first phase by placing banners in
                the middle and leaving them there until you either phase the boss or have to move because of
                orbs being shot out from the middle. If you have to move you place the banners halfway to the
                edge where you will stack so they still cover the group, but also so you get the buff while moving
                there and while moving back to the middle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similar ideas present themself for phase 2. The diagram above should somewhat show how the
                phase plays out. You start with the banner in the middle as you stack there with the group, and
                then assuming you do not get ported you pick up the banners and place them towards the arrow
                marker such that it covers the group and is easy to pick up and replace while moving back to the
                middle. Then the banners should already there be placed slightly towards circle such that it
                covers both current position at the middle and covers most of the next position at circle, once
                again with the idea in mind that it will be easy to pick them up and replace them towards the
                next edge position which will be heart after circle.
