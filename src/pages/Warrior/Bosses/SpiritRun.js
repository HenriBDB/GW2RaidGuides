                Spirit Woods is split into 3 main parts. The circle fiesta in the beginning, the spirit run, and the button puzzle.
                You should not run banners for any of these parts.
                <br/>
                For the circle fiesta you need mobility skills and cleave. I personally prefer the condition build for cleave,
                as it is easy to cleave multiple ghosts at once with Scorched Earth and Flaming Flurry, but Arc Divider on Greatsword
                can do an amazing job as well. Having Sundering Leap to jump to and from the adrenal mushrooms is a great addition, and
                Outrage  can be taken to stunbreak any kicks from the ghosts. For the last utility you can run "Shake it off!" for condition cleanse and more stunbreaks.
                <br/>
                For the spirit run you should play power to kill the walls faster, make sure to grab the Signet of Fury instead of Banner of Discipline
                as you will have problems with reaching the crit cap without. Banner of Strength can be replaced with Outrage for stunbreaks and berserk extension.
                <br/>
                For the button puzzle in the end you can run whatever you want, just go to a button where no one is at and stay on it, and stay alive while you wait for the other buttons.
