                There are not a whole lot for warrior to do on Twisted Castle as it is a very straightforward event.
                You can do the jump skip at the start with Savage Leap (Sword 2) and some careful positioning, but other
                than that, just bring as many movement skills as you can to get to the end faster once all the buttons have been pressed.
                I would recommend Sundering Leap, Bulls Charge and Stomp.
            </p>
