                This is a more complicated encounter. It is not too bad in terms of the mechanics the warrior
                has to deal with, but the banners can be hard to manage if you do not plan ahead of time. Both
                builds are playable here, but power is usually prioritized because the CC it can bring for
                breaking the Hydra and Qadim breakbar(s) be it necessary. You will likely be asked to tank the
                Wyvern which the group is currently not engaged with. Save your dodges for the 1-2 knock back
                into pin down combo as this is the only attack which can kill you. You only need to dodge the
                knockback, and then you can hug the boss hitbox and the pin down will not hit you. If you are
                tanking the far Wyvern you will have to make sure that you are facing its wind attack away from
                the group when it happens.

                For the power build you want to bring Maces to CC mainly the hydra, which has a 1500
                breakbar, and this needs to be broken quickly which the Maces are great for. Depending on team
                composition and skill level of the group, it can be beneficial to run Tactics traitline instead of
                Strength, but per usual this is most likely not the case for most pug groups. Remember to cleave
                the magma golems and larvae when you can and make use of the extra adrenaline gained from
                doing so. You can take Outrage here as the phases can get rather lengthy, but keep in mind that
                phase timing includes the time going to pyres and back. I would personally run Signet of Might
                instead.

                For the condition build your main concern is cleave. Cleaving the magma golems and larvae
                from afar during the burn phases and the pre-phases where adds spawns as well. Shattering
                Blow is a huge asset on this boss as it can be used to block the shockwaves Qadim creates, and
                to block the Wyvern attacks. The stability gained from the skill can also render the knockdown
                from some of Qadim’s attacks mute.

                The bannering for this encounter is simple on a phase to phase basis, but the fact that the
                pattern is different for every phase means that there is quite a bit to keep track of through the
                entire encounter. The patterns are fairly simple up until the Wyvern phase, where you have to
                get creative in how you manage the banners while both tanking the Wyvern and getting decent
                uptimes on the group.
                For the start of the encounter you want to put the banners down near the position the Hydra
                spawns at, and as/if the Hydra jumps to another platform you pick up the banners and wait with
                replacing them near the center of the arena until the Hydra is dead. The banners near the
                middle should last until pre-phase 2 starts, but if you need to break Qadim’s breakbar you
                should recast your banners during the CC. Pre-phase and phase 2 are practically the same, drop
                banners where the Destroyer spawns and pick them up as it is killed and replace them near the
                middle of the arena where Qadim will be for phase 2. Pre-phase 3 is where it gets interesting.
                Assuming you are tanking the far Wyvern you need to drop the banners on the group in such a
                way that they get the buff, but the banners are not too far away from you. When the Wyvern
                does its wind attack you then want to rush over and replace the banners for their next position
                maybe even helping out with CC with Tremor, before then rushing back to tank your Wyvern.
                Once both Wyverns are dead you pick up the banners and wait with putting them down again
                until you reach Qadim for phase 3. On phase 3 you have to pick up banners and replace them as
                Qadim dashes from corner to corner, and when he moves to the final platform. The banners
                placed on the final platform should be the last and should not need to be refreshed.
