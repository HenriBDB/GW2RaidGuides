                You can play both power and condition for this encounter, though the rate at which the adds die
                at makes power overall stronger as you can help burst the adds down. As power you should
                bring a single offhand Mace with paralyzation sigil to quickly break the bars of the Champion
                Branded Djinn with Tremor and Head Butt. The condition build should just be concerned with
                cleaving multiple targets as well as using Head Butt to help break the Djinn bars.

                During the orb retrieval you put the banners in the middle of the capture points and pick them
                up and replace them at the next capture point once the prior one has been captured. For the last
                part of the event you want to precast your banners on the Djinn to the left of the gate, and once
                it has been killed you pick up your banners and recast them to the right of the gate where you
                will kill the other 2 Djinn.
