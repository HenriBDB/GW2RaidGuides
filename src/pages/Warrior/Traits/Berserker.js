            The Berserker trait-line is a DPS oriented elite specialization. This is the trait-line both the
            Power- and Condition build builds around. It has great power options and great condition
            damage options, which on top of the primal burst which the trait-line unlocks makes it the
            single best option for banner builds. The primal burst Decapitate on top of Blood Reaction and
            Bloody Roar provides a solid core for the power build, and both the burst skills on Sword and
            Longbow along with Last Blaze, Heat the Soul, and King of Fires provide a huge boost to the
            condition build, along with access to Torch as a weapon. You always run this trait-line.

            Berserk is the core mechanic of the berserker. The standard burst skill is replaced by berserk
            which only can be activated with a full 30 adrenaline, but once activated you gain access to
            primal burst skills. Berserk lasts 15 seconds on its own but can be extended through various
            means, such as Smash Brawler or Rage skills. The primal burst skills only cost 10 adrenaline but
            carry power similar to level 3 bursts from the core specialization. Berserk is what makes both
            the power and condition damage rotations feel incredible fast-paced, as you are trying to get as
            much done within its duration as possible. Overall an amazing concept, that carries over super
            well from the core concepts.

                This is primarily used for the power build, as more berserk duration means more time with all
                the amazing modifiers and bonuses berserk provides. It should be seen as a 33% increase to the
                base duration which is fairly strong. Run this on power, it is good.

                This is primarily used for the condition build, but also some burstier variants of the power build.
                It holds the most value when you have at least 2 Rage skills which are used frequently. Burning
                is the strongest condition in the game, having the highest base damage of all conditions.
                Confusion can beat it under the right circumstances, but on a base-case Burning is better.
                Overall a great trait, always take this on the condition build.

                This trait can in theory also be used for burstier fights but is only really good in fractals. It can
                be used to break the self-stun from headbutt so that you can start your burst sooner, but in the
                end that 1 second only matters on ultra-short phases. I would not recommend using this.

                The only useful part of this trait is the Quickness, the superspeed is irrelevant for raids. But the
                quickness ensures that you will have quickness for the first bit of your berserk, even if the
                quickness source is slow with applying quickness. Nothing game-breaking, it is just alright.

                This is amazing for power, and part of the reason why power wants to remain in berserk as long
                as possible. Warrior has no access to viable crit chance modifiers which means they have to run
                a lot of precision which in turn provides a lot of ferocity thanks to this trait. Ferocity is probably
                the strongest stat for any power build. Run this on power, always.

                Torch is already strong for the condition build as it is, but with the reduced recharge as well as
                120 base condition damage, this trait is insanely good. The bonus while wielding Torch means
                that when on the Sword/Torch weapon-set you get a total of 240 extra condition damage thanks
                to this trait and Blademaster. It is the better option for the condition build so you take it, always.

            <p>
                This trait is not bad at what it aims to do, it is just completely worthless in raids and is
                completely outshined by the alternatives, Blood Reaction and Heat the Soul. Could, in theory, be
                used with some niche hand-kiting build but ending Berserk early works against the goal of the
                specialization which is the remain in berserk as long as possible. Do not run this, ever.

                This is an incredible bonus. The lack of toughness Might look scary, but the presence of a healer,
                and the fact that Blood Reckoning is an insane healing skill, makes this penalty irrelevant. You
                are very unlikely to go down due to having 700 toughness during Berserk, rather than 1000.
                The bonus to power and condition damage is incredible for both the power build and condition
                build. This trait is fantastic.

                A fantastic bonus for power, and another reason to stay in Berserk as long as possible. With
                Berserker’s Power, I could not stress enough how good 21% was, this trait gives a 20% bonus
                though slightly more conditional in that it only applies during Berserk, where Berserker’s
                Power can be upheld close to permanently. So, while it is not quite as strong it is still incredibly
                strong and provides a lot for the Berserk burst. You always run this on power.

                This is the best example of what a grandmaster trait should look like. It provides a lot of
                bonuses which independently are good, but nothing more than that, but the combination of all
                these bonuses being in one trait makes them fantastic instead. The increased Burn duration
                alone would have been enough for the condition build to run it, but the addition of fire auras on
                crits (with a 15 seconds cooldown between activations) and the ability to detonate the aura for
                a huge amount of Burning is amazing as well. Every condition build with Burning as a main
                condition wants this trait. Always run this for the condition build.

                This trait has no place in raids. Getting back the 300 toughness you otherwise lose from Fatal
                Frenzy is nothing grand, and the stability and Might on stun break are irrelevant in raids.
                Do not run this, ever.
